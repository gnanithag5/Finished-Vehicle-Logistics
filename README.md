## **Overview**

Efficient vehicle logistics management is vital in auto manufacturing plants to streamline operations and reduce resource waste. However, locating vehicles in large holdings is challenging due to constant inventory movement and the lack of systematic tracking. To address this, an IoT solution was developed to help employees quickly identify vehicle locations, enhancing efficiency. After evaluating cutting-edge technologies, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and RFID with Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), the RFID-RTLS solution was chosen for its superior range, readability, and scalability.
